RT-Thread is an open source IoT operating system from China, which has strong scalability: from a tiny kernel running on a tiny core, for example ARM Cortex-M0, or Cortex-M3/4/7, to a rich feature system running on MIPS32, ARM Cortex-A8, ARM Cortex-A9 DualCore etc.

## IDE ##

For Windows:
This project is cross build in windows system.
So we suggest you chooes visual studio code as ide for development.
In that case,you can build project through press the hot key "Ctrl+Shift+B",and downlode firmware through click Terminal-RunTask "sunxi-fel download bin file"
For Linux:
Now that you've chosen Linux, sure you can handle all things

## Usage ##

RT-Thread RTOS uses [scons](http://www.scons.org) as building system. Therefore, please install scons and Python 2.7 firstly. 
So far, the RT-Thread scons building system support the command line compile or generate some IDE's project. There are some option varaibles in the scons building script (rtconfig.py):

* ```CROSS_TOOL``` the compiler need to ```use arm-eabi-gcc``` 
* ```EXEC_PATH``` the path of compiler. 

In SConstruct file:

```RTT_ROOT``` This variable is the root directory of RT-Thread RTOS. If you build the porting in the bsp directory, you can use the default setting. Also, you can set the root directory in ```RTT_ROOT``` environment variable and not modify SConstruct files.

When you set these variables correctly, you can use command:

    scons 

under BSP directory to simplely compile RT-Thread RTOS.

like build command:

    cd ./bsp/f1c/
    scons -j8


clean command:

    cd ./bsp/f1c/
    scons -c

 
NOTE: RT-Thread scons building system will tailor the system according to your rtconfig.h configuration header file. For example, if you disable the lwIP in the rtconfig.h by commenting the ```#define RT_USING_LWIP```, the generated project file should have no lwIP related files.
